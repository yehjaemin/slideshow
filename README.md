# Slideshow
A demo slideshow with mouse, keyboard, and touch controls. Inside the code you can find examples of object-oriented programming, animation callbacks, and polyfills. Although I used solid colors in the slides, the constants file can be modified to accomodate photos, gifs, and embedded videos. Please enjoy!
